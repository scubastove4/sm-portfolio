      I am a full-stack software engineer who enjoys travel and learning
      creative methods for crafting user-friendly, interactive applications and
      software. I approach each language and framework like traversing a new
      city or country - diving in head-first to see everything they have to
      offer, manipulating something elaborate, yet familiar, into an experience
      the user wants to revisit. Along the journey, I relish the opportunity to
      share the knowledge gained with my teammates. My background in the
      food-service industry, mental health and substance use care, and
      healthcare operations, makes me flexible and adaptable to rapidly changing
      circumstances.
